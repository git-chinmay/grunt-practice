GRUNTFILE.js

- Configure our tasks and tells our plugins where to find certain files
- Load plugins into the grunt file (e.g uglify)
- Register tasks which needs to be run

To use plugin
- visit https://gruntjs.com/plugins for various plugins
- npm install <plugin> --save-dev
- Copy the plugin name and put it in gruntfile.js 
  NOTE: For plugin test the project files CSS and js are taken from https://github.com/iamshaunjp/grunt-playlist

Concatinte 3 js files into 1 file
- Define the source file and destination path where concatenated file saved in grunt.initConfig
- run the grunt command in terminal : grunt concat 
- Same can be done for CSS

What if I want to run one concatination at a time?
- Create task runner
- Run that task only
